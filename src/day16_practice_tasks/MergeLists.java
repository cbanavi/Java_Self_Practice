/*
2. Create a class named MergeLists and write a program that merges two given lists of integers into a third list. Ensure that the third list contains no duplicate elements and maintains the original order of elements from the input lists.

         Example:
            list1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
            list2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100}

         Output:
            list3 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100}
