/*
3. Create a class named CommonElements and write a program that identifies the common elements in two given sets of integers and returns a third set containing these common elements.

         Example:
            set1 = {10, 8, 11, 20, 5, 0}
            set2 = {30, 0, 20, 40, 50, 10, 60}

         Output:
            set3 = {0, 10, 20}
